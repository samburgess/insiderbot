We now have a solidified plan for our models. Our plan for initial action is as follows. We are going to take stock information from many companies across different industries to create a model to predict what is normal in the stock market. Initially we plan to use many different types of companies of any type, but later plan to compare this to dividing companies by industry to see what gives better results. Once we have trained a model for predicting what is normal, we will train another model that takes input to predict the anomaly of insider trading. The input is data from our prediction model, stock data from known cases of insider trading, and cases where insider trading. We are also considering including stock data from other companies around the same time period to see if anything unusual is just an overall market trend or company specific. More specifically, we want to do time series prediction on multiple time series' for each stock. We have a volume, close price, open price, and adjusted close for each stock. As such, we are going to run the data through a CNN that will take a channel of input in for each of these values, and output some single vector over time that will be the input to our bidirectional RNN. 


We have taken big steps towards formatting and compiling all of our data. We have created more models and hope to have most of them created by Sunday, the next milestone. 


We have mostly been working together.


The main obstacle we have encountered was realizing that yahoo finance does not provided data on delisted stocks, and many of cases of insider trading are on delisted stocks. We have started to over come this obstacle by switching to a new api that has data for delisted stocks.
